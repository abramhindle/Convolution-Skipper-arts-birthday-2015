A composition for Art's Birthday 2015.

SkruntSkrunt -- Theft/Art/Theft

The intent is to smash a microphone on capture 1 and a piezo contact mic on
capture 2 to a script of 10 minutes of performance.

The smashing is convolved against granular synthesis of these sounds:

    O all you who walk by on the road, pay attention and see:

        if there be any sorrow like my sorrow.

    V. Pay attention, all people, and look at my sorrow:

        if there be any sorrow like my sorrow.
